description: "Kokofreakbean makes the kind of mind-frying videos that can take a while to recover from. Case in point is his newest music video for EPROM's track \"Center of the Sun.\" The track itself is a glitchy wub of electronica and Koko's volatile visuals pulse and warp to the immersive beats."
